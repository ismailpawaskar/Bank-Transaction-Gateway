# Banking Transaction Gateway (System Prototype)

## Overview
This project is a prototype that replicates the backend of a banking system using Python. The system enhances security through OTP verification and supports various banking transactions, with real-time updates reflected in an Excel sheet.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Verifies user credentials using One Time Password (OTP) sent to the user.
- **Security Measures**: Allows three attempts for OTP validation before blocking the account to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Transaction Management**: Enables users to perform desired transactions post successful login.
- **Real-time Updates**: Updates the final total balance in an Excel sheet after each transaction.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/banking-system-prototype.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd banking-system-prototype
    ```

## How It Works
- *User Authentication*: The user logs in by entering their credentials. An OTP is sent to the registered mobile number for verification.
- *OTP Verification*: The user must verify the OTP within three attempts. If the attempts exceed three, the account is blocked.
- *Perform Transactions*: Upon successful OTP verification, the user can select the type of transaction (e.g., deposit, withdrawal) to perform.
- *Update Excel Sheet*: After the transaction, the updated balance is reflected in the Excel sheet.
